# Villa College Library Management System
This is a project I did for my Objected Oriented Systems Development module at college.  

We were asked to implement the design from [Educative's Library Management System design](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview/RMlM3NgjAyR).

- Uses MySQL. A database dump is included.
- Config lives in the env file
- Documentation I made for college is in [How To Use.docx](How%20To%20Use.docx)
